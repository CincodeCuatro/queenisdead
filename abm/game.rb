If the first monarch is able to hold the throne within their dynasty for 3 consecutive years, they win.

If the crown is held by the same Dynasty for 6 consecutive seasons they win.

If Crisis falls upon the realm 3 times everyone loses and the game is over.

If every member of a single family Dynasty is imprisoned or killed, the current monarch has won.

Else, the one who holds the throne at the end of the 5th year wins.
